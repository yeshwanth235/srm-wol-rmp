		<h1>Frontal</h1>
		<p> We don't just sell the websites, we create website that <b>SELL</b></p>
	</div>
	<div class="main">
		<h2>What is frontal ?</h2>
		<p><b>Frontal</b> means which is directed at the front. This is for the beginnner of frontend of a website. Where forntend means which is seen by user which containing text, images, buttons etc.,. and their is also backend for a website which contain all th database which is required for backend. </p>

		<h3>Difference between the forntend and backend </h3>
		<p>Front-End Web Development and Back-End Web Development have quite a few differences. While front-end is heavily based on designing to make your website as attractive as possible, back-end deals with all the complicated and messy stuff that actually makes your website run (like database operations, user authentication, application logic, etc). This is the reason that front-end is often known as client-side while the back-end is commonly known as server-side for a web application.

        In spite of the differences between <b>Front-End</b> Web Development and <b>Back-End</b> Web Development, they are actually two sides of the same coin!!! Both of them are equally important and a website only works correctly when they work in tandem.
		</p>

		<p>There are <b>six</b> main things that a frontend developer should learn :</p>
		
		<div class="contents"><b>Contents :</b></div>
		<div class="contents-list">
			<ul>
				<li>HTML & CSS</li>
				<li>Javascript</li>
				<li>Jqurey</li>
				<li>Framework</li>
				<li>Debugging & Testing</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
		<div class="contents-item">
			<h3>HTML & CSS</h3>
			<h5>HTML (HyperText Markup Language)</h5>
			<p>The primary thing to keep in mind, the supermagic key, is that <b>HTML</b> is used for meaning and <b>CSS</b> is used for presentation. HTML is nothing more than fancy structured content and the visual formatting of that content . And some basics tags in html for beginners to learn.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Getting Started: What you need to do to get going and make your first HTML page.</li>
				<li>Tags, Attributes and Elements: The stuff that makes up HTML.</li>
				<li>Page Titles: Titles. For Pages. </li>
				<li>Paragraphs: Structuring your content with paragraphs.</li>
				<li>Headings: The six levels of headings.</li>
				<li>Lists: How to define ordered and unordered lists.</li>
				<li>Links: How to makes links to other of pages.</li>
				<li>Images: picture representation</li>
				<li>Tables: How to use tabular data.</li>
				<li>Forms: Text boxes and other user-input thingamajigs.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)</h4>
			<p> <b>Cascading Styles Sheets</b>, is a way to style and present <b>HTML</b>. Whereas the HTML is the meaning or content, the style sheet is the presentation of that document. Some of the properties are:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Colors - How to use color.</li>
				<li>Text - How to manipulate the size and shape of text.</li>
				<li>Margins and Padding - How to space things out.</li>
				<li>Borders - Erm. Borders. Things that go around things.</li>
			</ul>

        	<h3>Javascript</h3>
        	<p>Determining the function of a webpage, <b>JavaScript</b> is a programming language. If you need to add audio and video, games, scrolling capabilities, or animations, you’ll need to know JavaScript. Not to mention it’s the most popular programming language in the world, so it’s a pretty valuable skill to learn just to be able to keep up with the competition. An example :</p>
        	<img src="D:\SRMWOL\javascript.jpg" height="300px" width="450px">
        </div>
        <div class="contents-item">
        	<h3>JQurey</h3>
        	<p><b>JQuery</b> is a cross-platform JavaScript library that contains a collection of plugins and extensions, like shortcuts to make JS developing faster and easier. It helps you add ready-made elements to webpages that you can customize as you need to. You can use it to automatically rearrange and resize grid layouts, autocomplete in searches, and add countdown timers. If nothing else, using jQuery will boost efficiency, limit human input error, thus improving overall productivity.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="contents-item">
        	<h3>Framework</h3>
        	<p>Also referred to as “<b>CSS frameworks</b>,” these are packages containing pre-written, standardized code in files and folders. They give you a base to build on while still allowing flexibility with the final design. Where <b>angular js</b>,<b> react</b>, etc., come under framework. Typically, front-end frameworks contain the following components: </p>
        	<ul>
        		<li>A grid which makes it simple to organize the design elements of your website</li>
        		<li>Defined font styles and sizing that varies based on its function (different typography for headings versus paragraphs, etc.)</li>
        		<li>Pre-built website components like side panels, buttons, and navigation bars</li>
        	</ul>
        	<img src="D:\SRMWOL\frameworks.jpg">
        </div>	
        <div class="contents-item">
        	<h3>Debugging & Testing</h3>
        	<p>There are a few other frameworks and preprocessors that provide some valuable shortcuts, but before that debugging and testing is a pretty critical skill when it comes to developing a site. You need to know the drawbacks and limitations of your coding structures, so know various techniques like<b> unit testing</b>, <b>UI testing</b>, and more. Once you’ve uncovered those errors, you have to remove them—figure out why and how they’re happening and fix the problem. Once you’re familiar with one of these processes, it’s pretty easy to adapt to others.</p>
